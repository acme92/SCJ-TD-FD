1. Files description

Input files:
DeCoSTAR_Anopheles_WGtopo_Boltz_0.1_0.1_M1_scaffolds
   Gene order of all extant and ancestral species
   Format: species_id scaffold_id gene_name orientation
   The order in which the genes appear in the file is the order along the fragments (chromosomes, scaffolds, contigs, CARs)

DeCoSTAR_Anopheles_WGtopo_Boltz_0.1_0.1_M1_scaffolds_assignment
   Assignment of the fragments to possible chromosomes
   Format: fragment_name fragment_length prob_X prob_2L prob_2R prob_3L prob_3R
   fragment_name is ANC_id for ancestral species and EXT_id for extant species
   prob_AA is the probability that a given fragment is located on chromosome arm AA

DeCoSTAR_Anopheles_WGtopo_Boltz_0.1_0.1_orthogroups
   Gene families
   Format: ancestor_species_id descendant_species_id ancestor_gene_name descendant_gene_name gene_tree
   Each line represents two genes of the same family along a given branch (ancestor_species_id,descendant_species_id) of the species phylogeny
   If an ancestral gene has no descendant, descendant_gene_name=NIL
   If a descendant gene has no parent, ancestor_gene_name=NIL

Scripts:
python generate_Decostar_input.py
   Generates, from the three files described above, a single file per branch, containing two gene orders.
   Format of gene order:
   genome1 = ancestor (line 1 of the file)
   genome2 = descendant (line 2 of the file)
   a gene order is a sequence of fragments, each starting by #id_assignment, followed by a sequence of signed genes
   assignment is either X (X chromosome), A (autosomes), U (unassigned)
   gene names in both genomes are the names in the (trivial) ancestor
   ancestor genes with no descendants or descendant genes with no ancestors are not filtered out

  branch 

The 0.8 means that a fragment is assigned to X chromosome if prob_X >= 0.8 and to autosomes if prob_X <= 0.2 and is unassigned otherwise.

branch_AA_BB is the branch from species AA to species BB
